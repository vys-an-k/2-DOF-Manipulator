# 2-DOF-Manipulator

This is a custom designed 2 dof manipulator suitable for pick and place tasks of lightweight objects. It uses two MG995 servo motors for the base and shoulder joints, and the tool uses an SG90 servo motor. The entire setup is controlled with an arduino UNO. 

The circuit connections only consist of the 3 servo motors (signal wire connected to PWM pins) and power supply connected to the arduino board.
